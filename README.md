# twenty 👀

A lightweight app that enforces the 20-20-20 rule with gentle reminders to rest your eyes and reduce digital eye strain.

**What is the 20-20-20 rule?** - Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break by looking at least 20 feet away.

It forces you to take a break by taking over your screen with an overlay for 20 seconds with no way to remove it. You must take a break for 20 seconds before it lets you back to your screen.

## Mac

The Mac version is built with SwiftUI. It is an entirely menubar based app.

I do not have the paid Apple developer account currently. Because of this, Apple will block you trying to open the app because of security reasons.

To get around this, download the app and try to open it. Opening will be blocked.

Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Security > Open Anyway
