# twenty 👀

A lightweight app that enforces the 20-20-20 rule with gentle reminders to rest your eyes and reduce digital eye strain.

**What is the 20-20-20 rule?** - Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break by looking at least 20 feet away.

It forces you to take a break by taking over your screen with an overlay for 20 seconds with no way to remove it. You must take a break for 20 seconds before it lets you back to your screen.

## Mac

The Mac version is built with SwiftUI. It is an entirely menubar based app.
